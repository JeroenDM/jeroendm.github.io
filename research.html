        <h1>Research</h1>

        <p>In 2016 I started working on path planning for robot arms, at the KU Leuven research group <a href="https://iiw.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/acro">ACRO</a>. In recent years we’ve seen an increased demand for flexible production. By improving industrial robot motion planning algorithms and focussing on open-source
            development, I hope that small companies can stay competitive. My specific focus is on Cartesian path planning for applications such as robot welding, deburring, and painting.</p>

        <p>From 2014 to 2016 I worked in the beautiful city in Belgium, Ghent, on a project to describe and evaluate the quality of electric bicycles.          Electric bicycles an important part of the solution to create livable cities. But when companies or government organizations wanted to buy large quantities of bicycles, they need a systematic way to describe them. I created a simple website for the project, but it turns out the official domain does not exist anymore, so I put it on a <a href="http://www.jeroendemaeyer.be/tgvelo/">Gituh page</a>. The official description and partners of the project can be found <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tgvelohomepage/the-project">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Sampling-based Tube Following for Redundant, Planar Robotic Manipulators</h3>

        <code>Jeroen De Maeyer, Mark Versteyhe, Eric Demeester</code>

        <p>This paper introduces a global, sampling-based motion planning approach to the tube following problem for
            redundant robot manipulators. Tube following is a motion planning problem where an under-defined
            end-effector path is given. We introduce a novel combination of existing task space and redundant
            configuration space sampling techniques. These techniques are applied to the tube following problem,
            comparing three different sampling techniques: uniform grid, uniform random and Halton sampling. In
            addition, an incremental sampling technique is proposed, specifically for tube following problems.
            Eventually, iterative grid refining is used to locally optimise path cost. Experimental results demonstrate
            the clear potential of these techniques to achieve fully automatic, collision-free motion planning for tube
            following with redundant robot manipulators. Our planning software is publicly available.</p>

        <h3>Cartesian path planning for arc welding robots: Evaluation of the descartes algorithm</h3>
        <code>Jeroen De Maeyer, Bart Moyaers, Eric Demeester</code>

        <p>Many industrial robot applications require fewer task constraints than the robot’s degrees of freedom. For
            welding robots, for example, rotations of the welding torch around its axis do not negatively impact welding
            quality. Furthermore, the tool center point’s Cartesian position and desired orientation as a function of
            time
            is often determined by the (manufacturing) process. Nevertheless, programming these robots can be time
            consuming. Reducing or eliminating this programming cost will allow robots to be used for producing small
            series. Recently, a promising software package for Cartesian path planning with the name Descartes was
            released
            by the ROS-Industrial community. To the authors’ knowledge, an in-depth description of this algorithm and an
            experimental evaluation is lacking in literature. This paper describes the path planning approach used by
            the
            Descartes package. Moreover, the software’s performance is evaluated for several key robot welding tasks and
            the
            encountered limitations are discussed. In addition, we show that the planner’s performance can be improved
            by
            changing the cost function that the planner’s graph search algorithm minimises.</p>


        <h3>The TGVelo Project: New Quality System for Electric Bicycles</h3>
        <code>D Callebaut, J De Maeyer, B Rotthier, J Cappelle, E Motoasca</code>

        <p>A system to evaluate and score different electric bicycles in an objective way. I presented this at the
            Scientist for cycling colloquium. This was a small conference filled with interesting people the day before
            Velo-city 2016 in Taipei.</p>
